# Feature: Tags

Tags are short strings that can be added to a session comment to denote a particular kind of work, such as `#bugs` or `#design` or any other sub-things you might want to track that are smaller than an overarching project name. Tags can be displayed on an invoice with a breakdown by time spent on each to keep better track of what's being worked on inside of a project.
